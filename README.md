Three distinct clusters were identified:
Active group (Blue Cluster): High steps (9000+ per day) and adequate sleep (7–9 hours). Represents health-conscious individuals.

Moderately active group (Green Cluster): Moderate steps (approx 6000 per day) and sleep (approx 6–7.5 hours). Likely busy professionals or casual exercisers.

Least active group (Red Cluster): Low steps (<5000 per day) and insufficient sleep (<6.5 hours). Indicates a sedentary lifestyle, potentially unhealthy habits.

Key Findings:
Higher activity levels are associated with better sleep.

The least active group may require interventions for better health habits.

The data can be used for personalized fitness & sleep improvement recommendations.

Future Improvements:
Optimize clustering (e.g., Elbow method).

Include more features (heart rate, calorie intake) for deeper analysis.

Conclusion: KMeans clustering successfully categorized different lifestyle patterns, helping users and researchers understand the relationship between physical activity and sleep quality.
